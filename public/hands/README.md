# Hand Images for Counting Game

To add hand images showing fingers for the counting game:

1. Create or download images of hands showing different numbers of fingers:
   - hand-1.png (one finger up)
   - hand-2.png (two fingers up)
   - hand-3.png (three fingers up)
   - hand-4.png (four fingers up)
   - hand-5.png (five fingers up)

2. Place the image files in this folder: `/public/hands/`

3. The app will automatically use these images. If images are not found, it will fall back to emoji hand icons.

**Image Requirements:**
- PNG format recommended
- Clear, simple images of hands showing fingers
- White or transparent background works best
- Size: 400x400px or larger (will be scaled automatically)

**Free Resources:**
You can find free hand/finger counting images on:
- Pixabay (pixabay.com) - search "hand fingers counting"
- Pexels (pexels.com)
- Unsplash (unsplash.com)
- Or create simple illustrations

The app will show these images to help teach counting with visual finger representation!
